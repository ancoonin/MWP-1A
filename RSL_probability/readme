This directory contains the Matlab codes modified from Hibbert et al. (2018) to apply our bootstrapping method 
that samples the full age and RSL distributions and propagates the associated error, as well as the Oxcal 4.4 
recalibrated C-14 age distributions for the data used in the paper.


The updated C-14 age distributions used in the paper are provided in NWScotland/ for the Northwest Scotland data site 
and in Hibbert_2018_database/ for all other data sites
