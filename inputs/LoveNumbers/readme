"prem.lXX.umvm7.lmvm7" represents the earth model of elastic structure from PREM (Dziewonski and Anderson, 1981), 
with the steady state upper and lower mantle viscosity profiles from the VM7 model (Roy and Peltier, 2018),and a
lithospheric thickness of XX.

"_eb" refers to the Extended Burgers Rheology Earth model

"_mxmc" refers to the transient viscoelastic rheology model of McCarthy et al. (2001),
        scaled to the reference Maxell VM7 Earth model

"_maxwell" refers to the Maxwell VM7 Earth model (Maxwell viscoelastic rheology)
