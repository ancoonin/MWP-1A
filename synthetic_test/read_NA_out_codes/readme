This directory contains sample codes to read/plot the output files from the NA Sampler (na.sum)
and NA Bayes (nab.out). 

i.   read_na_sum
required files: na.sum (output from NA sampler), predicted_data (output from NA Sampler), 
                and synthetic_data

  (a)na.sum is the summary file output from the NA Sampler

  (b)synthetic_data is an (nsites) x (ntimesteps) array of RSL over MWP-1A where:

  nsites = 6 (Tahiti, Barbados, Sunda Shelf, Hydrographer's Pass, Noggin Passage, NW Scotland)
  ntimesteps=37 (time steps used by the forward sea-level model)

  Each row contains the RSL timeseries at the sites (in the order as they are listed above).
  This is the data with which the NA sampler tries to minimize misfit. In a real inversion
  with the NA, the synthetic_data array is just the observed data.
  
  (c)predicted_data is an (nmodels x nsites) x (ntimesteps+1) array of RSL over MWP-1A where:

  nmodels is the total number of forward models sampled by the NA.

  Every 6 rows represent the predicted RSL timeseries at each site in the order as listed above.
  The value in the last column is the chi-squared misfit with the data, as computed within the 
  MWP-1A NA sampler codes.
