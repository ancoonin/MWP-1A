This directory contains the code developed for the MWP-1A application 
of the Neighborhood Algorithm (NA) Sampler (Sambridge, 1999).

Source code for the NA can be downloaded at https://iearth.edu.au/codes/NA/

See the provided demo for how to incorporate the MWP-1A driver and modules

The forward sea-level model code based on Kendall et al. (2005) is found in
Modules/sea_level.f90
