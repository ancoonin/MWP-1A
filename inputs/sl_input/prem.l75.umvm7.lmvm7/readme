The files in this directory are required to incorporate the self-consistent
loading history prior to MWP-1A using ICE-7G from the Last Interglacial (122 ka).
They are read in by the sea_level.f90 module, to do a forward calculation of MWP-1A 
sea-level change with the scenario generated by the Neighborhood Algorithm.

Note that the loading history prior to MWP-1A is dependent on the assumed global ice history used.

largeFiles.tar.gz contains two additional text files required by the forward MWP-1A sea-level model,
and were compressed in order to upload them to this repository.
